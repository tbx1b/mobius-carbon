§ 1 - SCRIPTS

  The source tree root conatins a number of scripts. This
  document will explain their basic utility. They are
  expected to be run on a POSIX compliant shell, and are
  interpeted by "/usr/bin/env sh" by default.

§ 1.1 "conf" and "deconf"

  For more information on these scripts, refer to "/man/Building.txt".

§ 1.2 "spawn.sh"

  Spawns an instance of QEMU running the base
  system binary.

§ 1.3 "carbon.cmake"

  A cmake script that is not intended to be ran by
  the developer. It is invoked by "conf".

§ 1.4 "aconf/linker.ld"

  The LLVM linkerscript.

§ 1.5 "Makefile"

  The Makefile can be invoked by simply running

    "make".

  Additional options can be invoked by running

    "make -C build <opt>" where opt:

        - "all"
        - "clean"
        - "rebuild_cache"
        - "edit_cache"
        - "preinstall" (not recommended)
        - "depend" (not recommended)
        - "help"
