ยง 1 - LAYOUT

The Carbon kernel has been neatly organised into
multiple subdirectories, each holding their respective source
files or config files. Some directories first build to a 
library (*.a). They are marked with an asterisk*.

ยง 1.1 Table

/aconf      - Holds compiler configuration scripts such as the linker.ld;

/chips      - source code for interfacing with commonly found chips in
          PC hardware;

/device     - code for interfacing with commonly found devices on PC 
          hardware. Note that these should generally not be exposed
          to the userland operating system as drivers, but rather
          be used privately (i.e. in-kernel);

/gnu        - source code adapted from various GNU projects. It's license
          can be found therein;

/i386,...   - architecture specific code. Assembly should only be stashed
          there, as the assembler isn't set up to look anywhere else.
          It is also good practice in general to keep architecture-specific
          code in it's own subdirectory;

/ipc        - code for inter-process communication and scheduling;

/kern       - the kernel "main loop" and helper functions;

/libc*      - a dumbed-down collection of headers and functions from the
          C standard library;

/libkern*   - kernel helper functions and data structres;

/sys        - system headers that shouldn't go in /libc or /libcarbon;

/vm         - physical memory management environment (ironically
          called "virtual memory").
